# Security Working Group

## Charter

The Security Working Group manages all aspects and processes linked to the Webpack Project's security.

The Security Triage Team is responsible for managing incoming security reports, to prepare security patches/releases, and to coordinate vulnerability disclosures. The nature of this task is sensitive, so only the Security Triage Team, TSC members, and (impacted) Core Maintainers are involved in the process.

### Responsibilities

- Define the Security triage role
- Define and maintain security policies and procedures for the project and the packages in scope (see [this table for scope details](https://github.com/webpack/security-wg/blob/main/docs/packages-in-scope.md))
- Provide guidance to the ecosystem on how to build more secure plugins
- Review and recommend processes for handling of security reports.
- Promote improvement of security practices within the Webpack project's ecosystem (For example: OSSF Scorecard, threat model, etc..)
- Recommend security improvements for the project and the packages in scope
- Support the TSC team on security triage as needed
- Support initiatives from the [OpenJS Foundation Security Collab Space](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/security-collab-space).
- Support initiatives from the OpenSSF [Best Practices for Open Source Developers Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers).
